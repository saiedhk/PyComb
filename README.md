PyComb: A Python Package for Combinatorial Special Functions

This Python package provides a number of special functions that are used in Combinatorics (Combinatorial Analysis).
Python is well-suited to combinatorial calculations as they normally produce outputs that are huge in terms 
of the number of digits representing them. The Python's built-in unlimited precision integers make such calculations
effortlessly easy.

In particular, the following functions are implemented in this package:
    Binomial, Multinomial, Catalan, Stirling of first kind, Stirling of second kind, Bell, Lah, Narayana,
    Delannoy, Motzkin, Schroder, Eulerian.

Users should refer to the following reference for definitions, and applications of the above functions.

These functions have been tested and verified against known results from reference tables.
There are no known bugs. However the users are encouraged to test before use.
The author would appreciate any bug reports or comments.
